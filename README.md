# Beta 1.7.3 World Generator for MC 1.16

This is a revitalization of Barteks2x/173generator, updated for Minecraft 1.16+.
It is currently in a semi-broken state. The plugin compiles and runs, but errors out when generating a world.


### Usage

Use it like any other generator To use it without a multi-world plugin, append this to your bukkit.yml:
```yaml
worlds:
     world_name:
          generator: 173generator
```
To use it with a multi-world plugin, follow the instructions for that plugin.
